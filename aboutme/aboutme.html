             I am 21 years old and  was born and raised in Weymouth, MA.

             adventure. My family is where my passion and my world of art
             truely began. Without them I never would have discoved this love
             of creating and designing.

             I am a graphic designer. I am drawn to color and design. 
             I enjoy immersing viewers in imagery that keeps the eye 
             interested and wanting to take every bit of it in. I am a 
             combination of multiple skills: creativity, design technology
             and marketing strategy. I thrive for new inspiration and experience 
             with the hope to one day be an important asset of a company.
